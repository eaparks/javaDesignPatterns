## Creational
    -Deal with the creation (construction) of objects
    -Explicit (constructor) vs. implicit (DI, refelection, etc.)
    -Wholesale (single statement) vs piecewise (step-by-step)
#### Builder  
    -When piecewise object construction is complicated,
    provide an API for doing it succinctly
#### Factories  
    -- Abstract Factory  
    -- Factory Method  
#### Prototype 
#### Singleton

## Behavioral
    -They're all different; no central theme
#### Chain of Responsibility  
#### Command  
#### Interpreter  
#### Iterator  
#### Mediator  
#### Memento  
#### Null Object  
#### Observer  
#### State  
#### Strategy  
#### Template Method  
#### Visitor  

## Structural
    -Concerned with the structure (e.g., class members)
    -Many patterns are wrappers that mimic underlying class' interface
    -Stress the importance of good API design
#### Adapter  
#### Bridge  
#### Composite  
#### Decorator  
#### Facade  
#### Flyweight  
#### Proxy
